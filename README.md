# TeaLeaves

This app, which is designed to track our ever-growing collection of tea,
was built solely as a Flutter learning exercise. Essentially, we have 
numbered containers (1-30), and this can be used to track what tea is
in what container, and to make a list of which tea(s) need to be
re-ordered.

This is the _front end_, and will build as an Android, iOS, or web 
app. THe _back end_ will, in due course, be built using Laravel.
